## üèóÔ∏è Project Overview

### About the Competition

The **Women in Data Science (WiDS) Datathon 2025** is an annual Kaggle competition designed to empower women in AI and data science through real-world machine learning challenges. This initiative is part of the **Break Through Tech AI Program**, which aims to bridge the gender gap in AI by providing hands-on experience, mentorship, and exposure to industry practices.

### Objective

Our team is working on **The Mysteries of the Female Brain: Sex Patterns in ADHD**. The challenge focuses on understanding how ADHD presents differently in females, aiming to create a machine learning model that predicts:

1. **ADHD diagnosis** (1 = ADHD, 0 = No ADHD)
2. **Sex** (1 = Female, 0 = Male)

### Real-World Significance

ADHD diagnosis can be more difficult in females, as they often present different symptoms than males. Our work aims to:

- Improve diagnostic accuracy for ADHD, particularly in females.
- Contribute to a better understanding of **brain activity patterns** across genders.
- Potentially impact the development of **personalized treatment** for ADHD by identifying these gender-specific patterns.

## üìä Data Exploration

### Dataset Description

Our project uses data from the **Healthy Brain Network (HBN)**, which includes:

- **Functional MRI connectome matrices**
- **Socio-demographic data**
- **Behavioral and parenting assessments**
- **ADHD diagnostic labels**

### Data Exploration & Preprocessing

- **Preprocessing Steps:**
    - Handling missing data
    - Encoding categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding)
    - Normalization and standardization of features
    
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    - Identified differences in brain activity patterns across ADHD and non-ADHD participants.
    - Analyzed **demographic distributions** (age, sex) and their correlation with ADHD.
    - Explored the feature importance for model development.
