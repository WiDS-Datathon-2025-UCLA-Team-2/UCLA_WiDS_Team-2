## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Execution  

Follow these step-by-step instructions to run this repository on **Google Colab** and **GitHub**.  

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)  
![Google Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Colab-F9AB00?style=for-the-badge&logo=googlecolab&logoColor=white)  
![Kaggle](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kaggle-20BEFF?style=for-the-badge&logo=kaggle&logoColor=white)  


### üìã Steps to Run  

### üè∑Ô∏è 1. Clone the Repository from GitHub  
   - Open **Google Colab**, start a new notebook, and run the following command to **download the repository**:  

     ```python
     !git clone https://github.com/UCLA-WiDS-Team/adhd-brain-prediction.git
     %cd adhd-brain-prediction
     ```

   - This will copy all code files from **GitHub** into your **Colab environment**.  


### üì¶ 2. Install Dependencies  
   - Install the required libraries manually using the following command. This includes libraries such as **pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn**, and others necessary for running the code:  

     ```python
     !pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
     ```

‚úÖ Automate installation of all required libraries, ensure version consistency across different setups, and save time by avoiding missing dependencies.
    
### üì• 3. Download Datasets from Kaggle  
   The datasets are hosted on **Kaggle**,  and it must be downloaded from the competition page:  
   üîó [WiDS Datathon 2025 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/widsdatathon2025/data)  

   #### üîë Setting Up Kaggle API  
   - First, install **Kaggle API**:  

     ```python
     !pip install kaggle
     ```

   - Upload your **Kaggle API key** (`kaggle.json`). You can generate this key from your Kaggle account under **Account Settings**:  

     ```python
     from google.colab import files
     files.upload()  # Upload kaggle.json
     ```

   - Move the API key to the correct directory and set permissions:  

     ```python
     !mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
     !mv kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
     !chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
     ```

   #### üìÇ Download and Extract the Dataset  
   - Run the following command to **download the dataset**:  

     ```python
     !kaggle competitions download -c widsdatathon2025
     ```

   - Extract the dataset:  

     ```python
     !unzip widsdatathon2025.zip
     ```

   - Load the dataset into a **pandas DataFrame**:  

     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     df = pd.read_csv("train.csv")  # Adjust filename if needed
     df.head()
     ```

#### üîë **Why Do You Need a Kaggle API Key?**  
   The **Kaggle API key** is required to **programmatically download datasets** from Kaggle directly into **Google Colab**. Without it, you would need to manually download the dataset from Kaggle and upload it to Colab. The key helps with:  
   - **Authentication** ‚Äì Kaggle restricts dataset access to registered users, so an API key verifies your identity.  
   - **Automated Downloads** ‚Äì Fetch datasets directly without manual intervention.  
   - **Colab Integration** ‚Äì Since Colab runs in the cloud, it doesn‚Äôt store your Kaggle login credentials.  
   - **Reproducibility** ‚Äì Ensures others running your code can fetch the exact dataset without extra steps.  

### üöÄ 4. Execute the Code  

#### üìå Running the Notebook  
   - Open the **Google Colab notebook** from the cloned repository.  
   - Run **all cells** sequentially to reproduce results.  

#### üèÉ Running a Python Script  
   - If executing a standalone Python script, use the following command:  

     ```python
     !python your_script.py
     ```

## üèóÔ∏è Project Overview

### About the Competition

The **Women in Data Science (WiDS) Datathon 2025** is a Kaggle competition aimed at encouraging women in AI and data science. This initiative is part of the **Break Through Tech AI Program** that seeks to bridge the gender gap in AI by offering real-world machine learning challenges.

### Objective

Our team is analyzing **The Mysteries of the Female Brain: Sex Patterns in ADHD**, a project designed to identify differences in ADHD diagnosis and manifestations in females using AI-driven predictions. The model predicts:

1. **ADHD diagnosis** (1 = ADHD, 0 = No ADHD)
2. **Sex** (1 = Female, 0 = Male)

### Real-World Significance

ADHD diagnosis can be challenging, especially in females, due to symptom presentations. Our model aims to:

- Improve **diagnostic accuracy** for ADHD in females
- Investigate **brain activity patterns** and their correlation with ADHD across genders
- Contribute to **personalized treatment** options for ADHD

---

## üìä Data Exploration

### Dataset Description

Our project leverages data from the **Healthy Brain Network (HBN)**, which includes:

- Functional MRI connectome matrices
- Socio-demographic data
- Behavioral and parenting assessments
- ADHD diagnostic labels

### Data Processing & Exploration

- **Preprocessing Steps:**
    - Handling missing data
    - Encoding categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding)
    - Feature normalization and standardization

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    - Visualized **brain activity patterns** and their link to ADHD
    - Examined **demographic distributions** and ADHD correlations
    - Assessed **feature importance** in model development

### Visualizations

## **üñºÔ∏è Impact Narrative**

  **Answer the relevant questions below based on your competition:**

  **WiDS challenge:**

  1. What brain activity patterns are associated with ADHD; are they different between males and females, and, if so, how?  
2. How could your work help contribute to ADHD research and/or clinical care?

As you answer the questions below, consider using not only text, but also illustrations, annotated visualizations, poetry, or other creative techniques to make your work accessible to a wider audience.

## üöÄ Next Steps & Future Improvements

- Address model limitations by incorporating additional datasets (e.g., more brain scans)
