# WiDS Datathon 2025 - UCLA Team 2

The WiDS Datathon challenged us to uncover the mysteries of the female brain, particularly the unique sex patterns observed in ADHD. By diving deep into functional connectivity and neural interactions, our research aims to reveal how the female brain differs in its response to ADHD. These insights could pave the way for more personalized, sex-specific approaches in ADHD diagnosis and treatment, ultimately demystifying the complex neural underpinnings that contribute to behavioral differences.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Execution  

Follow these step-by-step instructions to run this repository on **Google Colab** and **GitHub**.  

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)  
![Google Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Colab-F9AB00?style=for-the-badge&logo=googlecolab&logoColor=white)  
![Kaggle](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kaggle-20BEFF?style=for-the-badge&logo=kaggle&logoColor=white)  


### üìã Steps to Run  

### üè∑Ô∏è 1. Clone the Repository from GitHub  
   - Open **Google Colab**, start a new notebook, and run the following command to **download the repository**:  

     ```python
     !git clone https://github.com/UCLA-WiDS-Team/adhd-brain-prediction.git
     %cd adhd-brain-prediction
     ```

   - This will copy all code files from **GitHub** into your **Colab environment**.  


### üì¶ 2. Install Dependencies  
   - Install the required libraries manually using the following command. This includes libraries such as **pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn**, and others necessary for running the code:  

     ```python
     !pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
     ```

‚úÖ Automate installation of all required libraries, ensure version consistency across different setups, and save time by avoiding missing dependencies.
    
### üì• 3. Download Datasets from Kaggle  
   The datasets are hosted on **Kaggle**,  and it must be downloaded from the competition page:  
   üîó [WiDS Datathon 2025 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/widsdatathon2025/data)  

   #### üîë Setting Up Kaggle API  
   - First, install **Kaggle API**:  

     ```python
     !pip install kaggle
     ```

   - Upload your **Kaggle API key** (`kaggle.json`). You can generate this key from your Kaggle account under **Account Settings**:  

     ```python
     from google.colab import files
     files.upload()  # Upload kaggle.json
     ```

   - Move the API key to the correct directory and set permissions:  

     ```python
     !mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
     !mv kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
     !chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
     ```

   #### üìÇ Download and Extract the Dataset  
   - Run the following command to **download the dataset**:  

     ```python
     !kaggle competitions download -c widsdatathon2025
     ```

   - Extract the dataset:  

     ```python
     !unzip widsdatathon2025.zip
     ```

   - Load the dataset into a **pandas DataFrame**:  

     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     df = pd.read_csv("train.csv")  # Adjust filename if needed
     df.head()
     ```

#### üîë **Why Do You Need a Kaggle API Key?**  
   The **Kaggle API key** is required to **programmatically download datasets** from Kaggle directly into **Google Colab**. Without it, you would need to manually download the dataset from Kaggle and upload it to Colab. The key helps with:  
   - **Authentication** ‚Äì Kaggle restricts dataset access to registered users, so an API key verifies your identity.  
   - **Automated Downloads** ‚Äì Fetch datasets directly without manual intervention.  
   - **Colab Integration** ‚Äì Since Colab runs in the cloud, it doesn‚Äôt store your Kaggle login credentials.  
   - **Reproducibility** ‚Äì Ensures others running your code can fetch the exact dataset without extra steps.  

### üöÄ 4. Execute the Code  

#### üìå Running the Notebook  
   - Open the **Google Colab notebook** from the cloned repository.  
   - Run **all cells** sequentially to reproduce results.  

#### üèÉ Running a Python Script  
   - If executing a standalone Python script, use the following command:  

     ```python
     !python your_script.py
     ```

## üèóÔ∏è Project Overview

### About the Competition

The **Women in Data Science (WiDS) Datathon 2025** is a Kaggle competition aimed at encouraging women in AI and data science. This initiative is part of the **Break Through Tech AI Program** that seeks to bridge the gender gap in AI by offering real-world machine learning challenges.

### Objective

Our team is analyzing **The Mysteries of the Female Brain: Sex Patterns in ADHD**, a project designed to identify differences in ADHD diagnosis and manifestations in females using AI-driven predictions. The model predicts:

1. **ADHD diagnosis** (1 = ADHD, 0 = No ADHD)
2. **Sex** (1 = Female, 0 = Male)

### Real-World Significance

ADHD diagnosis can be challenging, especially in females, due to symptom presentations. Our model aims to:

- Improve **diagnostic accuracy** for ADHD in females
- Investigate **brain activity patterns** and their correlation with ADHD across genders
- Contribute to **personalized treatment** options for ADHD

<a id="impact-narrative"></a>
## **üñºÔ∏è Impact Narrative**

**WiDS Challenge:**

1. **What brain activity patterns are associated with ADHD; are they different between males and females, and, if so, how?**

   Our analysis of functional connectivity suggests that individuals with ADHD exhibit distinct neural activity patterns compared to those without ADHD. In particular, disruptions in the communication between regions responsible for attention, executive control, and emotional regulation were observed. Furthermore, preliminary results indicate potential sex-specific differences, where females may show alternative connectivity patterns or varying levels of activation in certain brain networks compared to males. These differences could be influenced by developmental, hormonal, or genetic factors, emphasizing the need for tailored approaches when studying ADHD.

2. **How could your work help contribute to ADHD research and/or clinical care?**

   By applying advanced machine learning techniques to functional MRI connectome data alongside socio-demographic variables, our work enhances the understanding of ADHD‚Äôs neural underpinnings. This improved insight can aid in:
   
   - **Early Diagnosis:** Providing biomarkers based on brain connectivity that may support earlier and more accurate identification of ADHD.
   - **Personalized Treatment:** Informing the development of targeted therapies that account for individual differences, including sex-specific neural profiles.
   - **Research Advancement:** Offering a framework for integrating complex neuroimaging data with clinical metrics, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive model of ADHD that can be validated in larger studies.

Overall, our findings aim to bridge the gap between neuroscience research and clinical practice, ultimately improving the diagnostic and therapeutic landscape for ADHD.

<a id="next-steps--future-improvements"></a>

## üöÄ Next Steps & Future Improvements

- **Model Limitations:**  
  - The current model, despite its high accuracy, may be sensitive to noise and outliers in the functional MRI data.  
  - Limited demographic diversity in the training data might affect the model‚Äôs fairness and generalizability.

- **Improvements with More Time/Resources:**  
  - Perform extensive hyperparameter tuning and explore advanced deep learning architectures to capture more complex patterns.  
  - Implement robust cross-validation techniques (e.g., nested cross-validation) to better assess model performance.  
  - Enhance data preprocessing and feature engineering to reduce noise and improve feature representation.

- **Additional Datasets/Techniques to Explore:**  
  - Integrate external neuroimaging datasets to validate model generalizability across different populations.  
  - Investigate model explainability methods (e.g., SHAP, LIME) to gain insights into feature importance and decision-making processes.  
  - Explore transfer learning approaches to leverage pre-trained models for similar neuroimaging tasks.
