## Project Overview

### About the Competition

The **Women in Data Science (WiDS) Datathon 2025** is an annual **Kaggle** competition designed to encourage women in AI and data science to develop their skills through real-world machine learning challenges. This initiative is part of the **Break Through Tech AI Program**, which aims to bridge the gender gap in AI by providing hands-on experience and mentorship.

### Objective

Our team is working on **The Mysteries of the Female Brain: Sex Patterns in ADHD**, a predictive modeling challenge focused on understanding how ADHD manifests differently in female brains. The goal is to build a multi-outcome machine learning model that predicts:

1.  **ADHD diagnosis** (1 = ADHD, 0 = No ADHD)
2.  **Sex** (1 = Female, 0 = Male)

### Real-World Significance

ADHD can be difficult to diagnose, especially in females, due to differing symptom presentations. Tools of this nature can:

-   Improve diagnostic accuracy for ADHD in women
-   Help researchers understand brain activity patterns in ADHD across genders
-   Support the development of personalized treatments for ADHD

## Data Exploration

### Dataset Description

Our project uses data from the **Healthy Brain Network (HBN)**, including:

-   Functional MRI connectome matrices
-   Socio-demographic data
-   Behavioral and parenting assessments
-   ADHD diagnostic labels

### Data Processing & Exploration

-   **Preprocessing Steps:**
    -   Handling missing data and cleaning inconsistencies
    -   Encoding categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding)
    -   Normalization and standardization of features
    -   Data stratification for balanced training
-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    -   Identified key differences in brain activity patterns
    -   Visualized demographic distributions and their correlation with ADHD
    -   Investigated feature importance in model performance

### Visualizations

-   **Brain connectivity matrix heatmap**
-   **Feature importance analysis**
-   **Distribution of ADHD vs. Non-ADHD participants by sex**
